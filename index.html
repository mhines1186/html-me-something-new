            <h2>The Alvarez</h2>
            <p>"I have been learning how to play the guitar since I was 14 years old. My first guitar was an acoustic guitar and the brand name was Alvarez. It was a very nice but very difficult guitar to lear on for a beginner. However, learning on such
                a difficult guitar made it easier to play other guitars in my life, so I am thankful for the tough beginning."</p>
