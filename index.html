            <h2>I play guitar</h2>
            <p>"I have been learning how to play the guitar since I was 14 years old. My first guitar was an acoustic guitar and the brand name was Alvarez. It was a very nice but very difficult guitar to lear on for a beginner. However, learning on such
                a difficult guitar made it easier to play other guitars in my life, so I am thankful for the tough learning curve in the beginning. Some of my favorite songs to play are "Folsom Prison Blues", by Johnny Cash, "Hotel California", by The
                Eagles, and various others that I have learned along the way."</p>

            <h3>BMX</h3>
            <p>"I enjoy the sport BMX, specifically the "Freestyle BMX" genre. I have been learning BMX freestyle since I was 12 years old and became very proficient at the sport. When I was 15, my best friend and I built a 15 foot wood half-pipe ramp and
                we spent many days practicing our tricks and perfecting them. I broke 3 bones before I turned 18 from the sport, I broke my wrist, collar bone, and my tibia. However, I never grew tired of the sport."</p>

            <h4>Native American</h4>
            <p>"I am Native American, I am from the tribe Cheyenne. I grew up learning about my culture and tribal history at pow wow's, sweats, and sundances. As a child, I knew my tribal language but as I've grown older, and no longer use my language on
                a daily basis, I have forgotten almost all of it. I do, however, plan to re-learn my language at a future time. I would like to pass down my language to my children. My Cheyenne name is "ho'honahke" which translates to "Big Stone", my
                grandmother gave me my Cheyenne name, on the day I was born. Which is a tradition in the Cheyenne tribe."</p>
